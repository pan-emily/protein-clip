#### TL;DR: 

Running ```main.py``` extracts proten-receptor data from Propedia, then builds + trains a CLIP model. 

Model versioning is based on time of run, so model/losses will be saved to directory determined by H-M-S we begin training the model. 


## Environment Setup

### If running locally: 
Create a new Anaconda environment from ```environment.yml``` using the command
    > ```conda env create -f environment.yml```

### If running on HPC: 

## Peptide-Receptor CLIP

## Protein-Protein CLIP 

## Protein-Receptor FILIP
