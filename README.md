# CLIP Model for Peptide-Receptor Interactions
CS 101 Project 
Contributors: Ayush Varshney, Emily Pan, Evan Zhang, Jadelynn Dao

Running ```main.py``` extracts proten-receptor data from Propedia, then builds + trains a CLIP model. 

Model versioning is based on time of run, so model/losses will be saved to directory determined by H-M-S we begin training the model.
